Industry model ::<br>
    Renewable Energy Power Plant Industry Development Research Division
Solar Farm Renewable Power Plant Industry  Ample Energy (AME),  will connect the cryptocurrency market with the renewable energy power plant industry, EV vehicle power station and retail through.  Renewable Energy Trading (Corporate — Community)

Technology and working principle ::
       This class of platform application solutions lays out smart contract terms for renewable energy traders for digital certification. An asset is a transaction between an organization and an organization to a community. Through management through blockchain technology, it builds the credibility of digital asset equity capital. and intermediary exchanges (Ame and Rent Token) using BlockChain cryptographic account reporting, digital asset special ledger. immutable technology for transparency and accountability It also supports real-time reporting. This makes it possible to submit the delivery of electric power to the enterprise and issue a bill of energy trading.

     # Writing a Project Adapter

Let's take a look at the calculate the value to see a minimal example of an adapter. Each project gets it's own sub-directory under `/contracts`, with an lendingpool.sol file containing the main code and settings.

```
projects De-fi Lending ::
└───contracts
    └───lendingpool.sol
    └───rest.sol
``` 
  <p>
    <strong>  AME run in platform, The technology on cross microfrid plug connect to follow up. Real-time energy trading and also in decentralized pool-based lending protocol built.
Users can earn interest on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. </strong></p>
  <p>
   
 <strong>  Rest Lending is a decentralized pool-based lending protocol built on on cross chain Ethereum + BSC. Users can earn interest on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. We call these users lenders. AME and Rest deposited by lenders will be transferred into a smart contract that aggregates total liquidity of each asset into a pooled fund, which is available for borrowers,to borrow. Loans are not matched individually between lenders and borrowers, but are taken from the pooled fund. Interest lenders earn come from interest that borrowers pay, distributed proportionately to the liquidity they provide.</strong></p>

concept and benefits ::
        Ample Energy is created under  the concept "Creator of change with technology in the renewable energy industry giving sustainability to every community”.
